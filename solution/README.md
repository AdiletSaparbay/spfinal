1)'cut' works like split, will divide problems

2)there is 'sed' to remove

3)'grep' to exclude lines that are

4)we will sort

5)we have two columns 'reference' and the name of the application and we will be the brother of the application from it

6)the applications have versions of the numbers i will erase them with 'sed'

7)And we will again sort 

8)then with "uniq -c" will group

9)for example:

mozilla

mozilla

chrome

if it's worth it

will change:

mozilla 2
chrome 1

10)next will sory by numbers and by names

11)and  have a number that was originally given

12)when write /top.sh 5 the first take 5 this nubmer

13)then awk the first begin well count total

for example:

mozilla 2

chrome1 
will be,general be 3 and this 3 will be count
in the second  will be used to divide by this number and calculate the percentage

14)printf used to output data by formatting

15)next chorme 1, mozilla2 will output

mozilla 2 66%
chorome 1 33

found percentage of division by total
